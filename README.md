# Nicole's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! Here you can learn more about me, my skills, interests, and how to get in touch.

I'm Nicole Marie, and my journey into web development and design has been anything but ordinary! With over 15 years as a cosmetologist and barber, I've always had a passion for creativity - whether I'm creating the perfect hairstyle or now crafting beautiful websites.
